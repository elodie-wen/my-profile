				<h1>Welcome to Elodie's profile !</h1>

				<p>Hi ! As you can see, this is my personal presentation page, after following the Le Wagon course on web design. Now, let me briefly present myself.</p>
				<p>I am Elodie Wen, an 18-year-old female 1st-year student at the GBBA Program of ESSEC Business School. I am French with Chinese origins who loves travelling, reading and discovering new things in general, as I am a very curious individual ! Here's more about some of my hobbies down below.</p>

				<h2>‚úàÔ∏è Travelling ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
				<p>Since I was little, I was always fascinated by the many different cultures existing in this world. I was lucky to have traveled to quite a few destinations, including : Portugal, China, UK, Croatia.</p>

				<h2>üìñ Reading üìñ</h2>
				<p>"Scientia potentia." ‚Äî Sir Francis Bacon </p>
				<p>Translating to "knowledge is power" from Latin. Since books are a gold mine of information, it was only logical that I would pick up reading as a personal hobby of mine. I tend to read of all genres, although I do have a preference for politics (fiction & non-fiction).</p>
				<p>My latest finding is <u>Kim Ji-Young: Born 1982</u> written by Namjoo Cho, a Korean writer. It tackles Korean societal topics and issues like patriarchy, traditions and discrimination which you can find more about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/19/kim-jiyoung-born-1982-cho-nam-joo-bestseller-review" target="_blank">here</a>.

				<h2>üì∏ Photography üì∏</h2>
				<p>As I travelled a lot while growing up, I also developped first, an interest in sight-seeing, then a want to immortalize those landscapes. Hence the photography. I am by no means a professional, but you can find more about my amateur work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zerryzu/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
